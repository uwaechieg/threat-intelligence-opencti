# OpenCTI Architecture Overview

OpenCTI operates as a containerized platform composed of multiple services, including:

- OpenCTI core platform
- Database
- Message queue
- Connectors

These components run in isolated Docker containers and communicate internally to process and store threat intelligence data.
